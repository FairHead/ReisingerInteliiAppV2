## Feature Validation Checklist

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes (P0) - 10 minutes

#### PlacedDevice Movement Arrows Test
```bash
# Manual Test Steps:
1. Open app → Main Page → select Building → select Level with devices
2. Tap a placed device to show movement arrows
3. Test each arrow direction:
   - ⬆️ Up: Device moves up, RelativeY decreases
   - ⬇️ Down: Device moves down, RelativeY increases  
   - ⬅️ Left: Device moves left, RelativeX decreases
   - ➡️ Right: Device moves right, RelativeX increases

# Acceptance Criteria:
✅ All four arrows respond within 100ms
✅ Touch targets are ≥44dp
✅ Position changes are accurate (±0.001)
✅ No visual jumps or misalignment
```

#### Dropdown Outside-Tap Test
```bash
# Manual Test Steps:
1. Open Structure dropdown
2. Tap outside dropdown area
3. Verify dropdown closes
4. Open Level dropdown while Structure open
5. Verify only Level dropdown remains open

# Acceptance Criteria:
✅ Only one dropdown open at a time
✅ Outside tap closes dropdown
✅ Opening new dropdown closes others
```

### 2. Performance Validation - 5 minutes

#### Pan/Zoom Performance Test
```bash
# Performance Test:
1. Load floor plan with 20+ devices
2. Perform continuous pan gesture for 10 seconds
3. Perform pinch-zoom gestures
4. Monitor frame rate (should be 55-60 FPS)

# Automated Test:
dotnet test --filter "Category=Performance"
```

#### Load Time Test
```bash
# Manual Timing:
1. Start app launch timer
2. Navigate: Building → Level → Floor Plan load
3. Measure total time from tap to complete render

# Acceptance Criteria:
✅ Initial page load ≤ 1.5 seconds
✅ Floor plan load ≤ 500ms
✅ UI response ≤ 100ms
```

### 3. Device Control Integration - 8 minutes

#### API Integration Test
```bash
# Prerequisites: Mock API server or test device
# Test Steps:
1. Configure test device IP/credentials
2. Test Open command → verify green state
3. Test Close command → verify red state
4. Test error scenario → verify error toast

# Automated API Test:
dotnet test --filter "Category=ApiIntegration"
```

#### State Synchronization Test
```bash
# Manual Test:
1. Open device via API
2. Verify UI shows "Open" state (green)
3. Close device via API
4. Verify UI shows "Close" state (red)
5. Test network error → verify error toast (3 sec, non-blocking)

# Acceptance Criteria:
✅ UI updates within 500ms of API response
✅ Color coding correct (green=open, red=closed)
✅ Error toasts are non-blocking
```

### 4. Enterprise Features Validation - 10 minutes

#### Compiled Bindings Test
```bash
# Build Test:
dotnet build --verbosity normal 2>&1 | grep -i "binding"

# Should show: "Using compiled bindings" messages
# Should NOT show: binding errors or warnings

# Runtime Test:
1. Run app in Debug mode
2. Check Output window for binding errors
3. Verify no binding-related exceptions

# Acceptance Criteria:
✅ Zero runtime binding errors
✅ All views use x:DataType
✅ Compile-time binding verification
```

#### Logging & Crash Reporting Test
```bash
# Logging Test:
1. Navigate through app
2. Trigger intentional error
3. Open log viewer (if implemented)
4. Verify structured logs with categories

# Crash Reporting Test:
1. Enable crash reporting (with consent)
2. Force app crash (test button)
3. Restart app
4. Verify crash report sent (if configured)

# Acceptance Criteria:
✅ Structured logs with severity levels
✅ In-app log viewer works
✅ Crash reporting requires user consent
✅ Privacy policy shown before consent
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Frame Rate Monitoring
```bash
# Automated Performance Test:
dotnet run --project PerformanceTests

# Expected Results:
- Pan/Zoom: 55-60 FPS sustained
- Memory: <100MB with 50 devices
- CPU: <30% during gestures
```

### Load Time Benchmarks
| Operation | Target | Test Method |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| App Launch | <1.5s | Stopwatch from Main() to UI ready |
| Floor Plan Load | <500ms | PDF render + device placement |
| Navigation | <100ms | Page transition timing |
| API Response | <500ms | Network request completion |

## Automated Test Execution

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
dotnet test --filter "Category=Unit"

# Expected: >90% pass rate
# Test Coverage: ViewModels, Services, Models
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# API Integration
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration"

# UI Integration  
dotnet test --filter "Category=UI"

# Performance Tests
dotnet test --filter "Category=Performance"
```

### Cross-Platform Testing
```bash
# Android (requires emulator)
dotnet build -f net8.0-android
dotnet test --framework net8.0-android

# iOS (macOS only)
dotnet build -f net8.0-ios
dotnet test --framework net8.0-ios

# Windows
dotnet build -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041
```

## Error Scenarios & Recovery

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Build Errors
```bash
# Dependency Issues:
dotnet clean
dotnet restore
dotnet build

# Platform-specific Issues:
dotnet workload install maui
dotnet workload update
```

#### Runtime Errors
```bash
# Binding Errors:
- Check x:DataType matches ViewModel
- Verify property names are correct
- Check for null reference exceptions

# Performance Issues:
- Monitor memory usage in Task Manager
- Check for memory leaks in device scanning
- Verify gesture coalescing is working
```

#### API Connection Issues
```bash
# Network Debugging:
- Verify device IP reachable (ping)
- Check credentials are correct
- Verify API endpoints are available
- Test with curl/Postman first
```

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Found
1. **Immediate**: Switch to previous working branch
2. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of rollback
3. **Investigation**: Identify root cause in separate branch
4. **Resolution**: Fix issues and re-test before re-deployment

### Rollback Commands
```bash
# Emergency rollback
git checkout main
git reset --hard previous-stable-commit

# Or revert specific commits
git revert commit-hash

# Rebuild and test
dotnet clean
dotnet build
dotnet test
```
