## Summary
This feature implements a comprehensive repository audit and specification enhancement for the Reisinger IntelliApp V4 (.NET MAUI application). The primary requirement is to audit all existing features, identify and specify acceptance criteria for known issues (particularly PlacedDevice movement arrows, dropdown interactions, and performance improvements), and incorporate enterprise best practices including compiled bindings, structured logging, crash reporting, and cross-platform optimization.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: C# 13 (default via .NET SDK 9), .NET 9.0, .NET MAUI 9.0  
**Primary Dependencies**: Microsoft.Maui, Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging  
**Storage**: Local storage via Preferences API, SecureStorage for credentials, file system for PDFs/images  
**Testing**: MSTest/xUnit for unit tests, UI automation testing, performance profiling  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform mobile (Android 5.0+, iOS 13+, Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+)
**Project Type**: Mobile (.NET MAUI single project with platform-specific implementations)  
**Performance Goals**: 60 FPS pan/zoom, <500ms PDF load, <1.5s initial page load, <100ms UI response  
**Constraints**: Memory efficient for 50+ devices, offline-capable, MVVM strict compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Single mobile app, 60+ functional requirements, 25+ existing Views/ViewModels/Services

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (single .NET MAUI project with platform folders)
- Using framework directly? YES (.NET MAUI, no wrapper classes)
- Single data model? YES (Models/ folder with clear DTOs where needed)
- Avoiding patterns? YES (using MVVM, DI, Command patterns as required by framework)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A (mobile app architecture)
- Libraries listed: Core app with Services/, ViewModels/, Views/, Components/, Controls/
- CLI per library: N/A (mobile app, not CLI application)
- Library docs: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, specs/ documentation

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES (specified in constitution and tasks)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES (TDD approach required)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? YES (will be enforced in tasks.md)
- Real dependencies used? YES (actual device scanning, PDF services, network APIs)
- Integration tests for: YES (API interactions, device scanning, storage operations)
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✅ ENFORCED

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? YES (FR-056: structured logging with in-app viewer)

- Error context sufficient? YES (comprehensive error handling and crash reporting)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? YES (semantic versioning in .csproj)
- BUILD increments on every change? YES (CI/CD pipeline will handle)

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Completed Artifacts:
1. **Data Model Analysis** → `data-model.md` ✅ COMPLETE:
   - Existing models documented (DeviceModel, PlacedDeviceModel, Building, Floor)
   - Enhanced models specified (AppSettings, PerformanceMetrics, LogEntry)
   - Validation rules and relationships defined

2. **API Contracts** → `contracts/` ✅ COMPLETE:
   - Enhanced IntellidriveApiService interface with device control and parameters
   - Core services contracts (IPerformanceMonitoringService, ILoggingService, etc.)
   - Request/response schemas with error handling

3. **Testing Strategy** → `quickstart.md` ✅ COMPLETE:
   - 30-45 minute validation workflow
   - Performance benchmarks and automated tests
   - Stakeholder demo script and rollback plan

4. **Agent Context Update** → `.github/copilot-instructions.md` ✅ COMPLETE:
   - Technical findings integrated
   - Current implementation focus documented
   - Performance budgets and contracts referenced

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
The /tasks command will create a comprehensive `tasks.md` file based on the 60 functional requirements in the spec, organized by priority and dependency order:

### Priority-Based Task Organization:
1. **P0 Critical Bug Fixes** (Tasks 1-15):
   - PlacedDevice movement arrows fix (3x3 Grid layout)
   - Hit-test alignment and touch area improvements
   - Dropdown outside-tap auto-close functionality
   - Deterministic device placement on reopen

2. **Performance Optimization** (Tasks 16-25):
   - Pan/zoom FPS improvements with coalesced gestures
   - Memory allocation optimization
   - Image downsampling and caching
   - Optional GraphicsView implementation

3. **Enterprise Features** (Tasks 26-40):
   - Compiled bindings (x:DataType) across all views
   - Structured logging service implementation
   - Crash reporting with user consent
   - Settings page and preferences management

4. **Device Integration** (Tasks 41-50):
   - Enhanced IntellidriveApiService with state sync
   - Device parameter editing functionality
   - Batch operations and error handling
   - API testing and mocking infrastructure

5. **Testing & Validation** (Tasks 51-60):
   - Unit tests for ViewModels and Services
   - Integration tests for API interactions
   - UI automation tests for critical workflows
   - Performance testing and monitoring

### Task Execution Approach:
- **TDD Order**: Test contracts → Integration tests → Unit tests → Implementation
- **Dependency Resolution**: Models → Services → ViewModels → Views → Components
- **Parallel Execution**: Mark independent tasks with [P] for parallel development
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each task includes verification steps and rollback procedures

### Testing Integration:
- **Contract Tests**: Validate API service interfaces first
- **Integration Tests**: Device scanning, storage operations, API calls
- **UI Tests**: Critical user workflows with automation
- **Performance Tests**: Frame rate, memory usage, load times under target conditions

**Estimated Task Output**: 50-60 numbered, sequenced tasks with clear acceptance criteria, testing requirements, and dependency management.

**IMPORTANT**: This planning phase describes the approach only. The actual `tasks.md` file will be created by the `/tasks` command with detailed implementation steps.

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected during design phase*

| Requirement Category | Complexity | Justification | Risk Mitigation |
|---------------------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| PlacedDevice Arrows | Medium | UI hit-test fixes require careful layout changes | Incremental testing, UI automation |
| Performance Optimization | High | 60 FPS target requires significant gesture optimization | Feature toggles, monitoring, rollback plans |
| Enterprise Features | Medium | Standard .NET MAUI patterns, well-documented | Gradual migration, comprehensive testing |
| Device API Integration | Medium | Extends existing service patterns | Mock testing, error simulation |
