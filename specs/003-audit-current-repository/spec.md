## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team member, I want a comprehensive audit of the current Reisinger IntelliApp repository so that I can understand all existing features, identify known issues, and plan future enhancements with clear acceptance criteria and performance targets.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current repository state, **When** I review the audit specification, **Then** I can see all existing features clearly marked with ✅
2. **Given** known issues in the codebase, **When** I read the specification, **Then** I find specific acceptance criteria for each issue with measurable success conditions
3. **Given** performance requirements, **When** I examine the spec, **Then** I see concrete performance budgets and enterprise best practices
4. **Given** the MVVM architecture, **When** I review the audit, **Then** I see respect for current patterns without suggesting rewrites

### Edge Cases
- What happens when new features conflict with existing MVVM patterns?
- How does the system handle platform-specific differences in device scanning?
- What are the failure modes for PDF rendering and device placement?
- How should the system behave when network connectivity is intermittent?

### Implementation Questions - RESOLVED

#### GraphicsView Overlay Implementation
**Question**: Should GraphicsView overlay be default or optional feature?  
**Resolution**: **OPTIONAL FEATURE** - Implement as user preference in Settings page  
**Rationale**: 
- Default behavior should maintain current reliability
- GraphicsView provides performance benefits for 50+ devices
- Users can opt-in based on their device count and performance needs
- Easy rollback if issues arise

#### Crash Reporting Service Selection
**Question**: What specific crash reporting service should be integrated?  
**Resolution**: **Microsoft App Center** (primary) with **local fallback**  
**Rationale**:
- Native .NET MAUI integration available
- Supports all target platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS)
- GDPR compliant with user consent management
- Free tier sufficient for initial deployment
- Local logging fallback ensures no data loss if service unavailable

#### Telemetry Requirements
**Question**: Are there existing telemetry requirements to consider?  
**Resolution**: **MINIMAL TELEMETRY** - Performance and crash data only  
**Rationale**:
- Track app performance metrics (load times, FPS, memory usage)
- Monitor crash rates and common failure patterns
- No user behavior tracking or personal data collection
- Explicit opt-in during first app launch
- Data retention limited to 90 days for troubleshooting

### Additional Implementation Clarifications

#### UI/UX Specific Decisions
- **Touch Target Sizes**: Minimum 48dp for accessibility compliance, 40-44dp for compact mode
- **Color Coding**: Green = Open/Available, Red = Closed/Error, Blue = Selected/Active, Gray = Disabled
- **Animation Duration**: 300ms for state transitions, 150ms for hover/press feedback
- **Error Display**: Toast notifications for 3 seconds, dismissible error dialogs for critical issues

#### Data Management Decisions
- **Storage Strategy**: Preferences for app settings, SecureStorage for credentials, File system for large data (PDFs, images)
- **Caching Policy**: Floor plans cached for 30 days, device lists for 24 hours, API responses for 1 hour
- **Sync Strategy**: Manual refresh for device status, automatic sync for critical state changes

#### Platform-Specific Considerations
- **Android**: Target API 21+ with runtime permissions, background service for device scanning
- **iOS**: iOS 15+ with proper entitlements, background task scheduling
- **Windows**: WinUI 3 with proper app lifecycle management
- **macOS**: Catalyst with native macOS behaviors and file system access

#### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: All ViewModels, Services, and utility classes (target 80% coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: API calls, storage operations, cross-platform compatibility
- **UI Tests**: Critical user workflows, gesture handling, accessibility compliance
- **Performance Tests**: Load times, memory usage, frame rates under various conditions
